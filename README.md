# Dumbledore's Office

## Project Usage
The game can be played either on a local server (single-player) or on a remote server (multi-player). The following steps need to be done in the terminal **from the dumbledores-office' directory**. Make sure you are running the game in an environment where the following packages are installed: `python-dotenv`, `requests`, `websocket-client`, `pygame`, and `Pillow`.

1. In order to interact with the chatbots throughout the room, you will need to [create an OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api-reference/authentication, and save it in '/dumbledores-office/COMP303_Project/.env'.
2. To launch the game server, run the following command: `python3 -m 303MUD.client_local`.
3. Once the game launches, use the arrow keys to move towards the house with the purple roof on the bottom left. Walk up to the door and press the up arrow to enter the house.
5. Once inside the house, you can explore our world however you like!
